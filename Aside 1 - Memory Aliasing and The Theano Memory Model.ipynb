      "\n",
      "The reason that <code>borrow=True</code> might create a copy of the internal memory is because Theano might lay out a shared varible in memory using an internal representation that you do not expect. When you create a shared variable by passing a Numpy array for example, then <code>get_value()</code> might return a Numpy array too - this is how Theano can make the GPU use transparent. (I don't understand this). But when your are using a GPU (or perhaps in the future, remote machines), then <code>numpy.ndarray</code> isn't the internal representation of your data. If you really want Theano to return the internal representation and to never make a copy, you can use the <code>return_internal_type=True</code> argument to <code>get_value</code>"
